- 👋 Hi, I’m @zyinix. From Sweden.  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming and everything that follows. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and everything else that programming has to offer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EASY projects since I am a beginner still. I only code when I have sparetime for it. I am a father of 2 which makes my sparetime
scarce.
